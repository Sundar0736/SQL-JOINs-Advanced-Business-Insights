# SQL-JOINs-Advanced-Business-Insights
# 🚀 SQL Online Business Case Study - JOINs & Analytics

[cite_start]This project is a comprehensive case study designed to practice and demonstrate SQL JOIN techniques using a realistic online shopping database[cite: 1, 4]. [cite_start]It focuses on extracting business insights from interconnected data[cite: 6, 7].

## 🛠️ Technology Used
* [cite_start]**Database Management System:** MySQL [cite: 91, 168, 298]
* [cite_start]**Language:** SQL [cite: 91, 168, 298]

## 📊 Database Tables
The analysis is performed across the following six tables:
* [cite_start]**Customers:** User profiles and locations[cite: 11, 21].
* [cite_start]**Orders:** Transaction dates and statuses[cite: 12, 21].
* [cite_start]**Order Items:** Breakdown of products within each order[cite: 13, 99].
* [cite_start]**Products:** Catalog of items available for sale[cite: 14, 100].
* [cite_start]**Categories:** Product classifications[cite: 15, 144].
* [cite_start]**Payments:** Financial transaction records[cite: 16, 228].

## 🔍 Key Analysis Sections
The project is divided into several analytical modules:
* [cite_start]**Basic JOINs:** Connecting customers to their orders to track regional activity[cite: 18, 19].
* [cite_start]**Multi-table JOINs:** Analyzing products, quantities, and calculating order totals[cite: 96, 113].
* [cite_start]**Product & Category Analysis:** Identifying product distribution across categories and finding unsold items[cite: 171, 189].
* [cite_start]**Payments & Order Status:** Tracking payment completion and identifying partially paid orders[cite: 221, 233].
* [cite_start]**Business Insights:** Calculating total revenue by customer, category, and city[cite: 300, 301, 331, 364].
* [cite_start]**Advanced Challenges:** Solving interview-level problems like finding top-selling products per category and identifying repeat customers[cite: 430, 446, 481].

## 💡 Core SQL Skills Demonstrated
* [cite_start]**Complex JOINs:** Proficiency in `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN`[cite: 23, 62, 175, 228].
* [cite_start]**Aggregations:** Using `SUM`, `COUNT`, and `MAX` to summarize data[cite: 115, 243, 436].
* [cite_start]**Filtering & Grouping:** Utilizing `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `WHERE` clauses for specific data subsets[cite: 34, 116, 239].
* [cite_start]**Window Functions:** Implementing `ROW_NUMBER() OVER` for advanced ranking logic[cite: 450, 452].
All database schemas, queries, logic, and analysis were created and written by me to demonstrate practical understanding of SQL concepts including JOINs, aggregations, and data analysis.
